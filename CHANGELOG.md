All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Critical: Double discount bug** - Discounts were being applied twice (once in item rate, once in total calculation)
  - Frontend now correctly uses `price_list_rate` for subtotal calculations
  - Backend reverse-calculates `price_list_rate` from discounted rate to prevent double application
  - Example: Item with 10% discount now correctly shows 90.00 instead of 81.00
- **"Disable Rounded Total" setting not working** - Backend was checking POS Profile instead of POS Settings
- Subtotal calculation now uses original price before discount (fixes display inconsistency)

### Changed
- Improved discount calculation logic with comprehensive documentation
- Added validation to prevent invalid discount percentages (now clamped to 0-100%)
- Enhanced error handling for rounding setting retrieval
- Added data integrity checks (price_list_rate must be >= rate)

### Improved
- Added detailed inline documentation for discount calculation flow
- Code cleanup with better comments explaining critical logic
- Separated discount calculation into clearly documented sections
